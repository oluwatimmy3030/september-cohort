Study at SQI at little or NO cost!
In 2011 SQI College of ICT, then known as SQI ICT Academy, launched a yearly scholarship program to open a wider window of opportunity to every promising individual who is passionate about acquiring an ICT skill, and today we have trained and certified over 10,000+ youths who currently hold important and viable positions in various organizations nationwide.
The scholarship program is open to every individual between the ages of 13 to 28.
This annual scholarship program gives everyone (i.e O-level, A-Level, School Leavers, Undergraduates, Employed Graduates, Unemployed Graduates etc.) an opportunity to take any of our ICT courses at little or no cost.
The scholarship program has over the years taken many unique approaches to identify and evaluate suitable candidates for the award of either full or partial scholarship.
